Hi! I am seaque, not the [Space Entanglement and Annealing QUantum Experiment](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/space-station-to-host-self-healing-quantum-communications-tech-demo) of NASA, though I had came up with the name a decade ago. Currently I am probably working on many things, with none of them turning into actual projects.
